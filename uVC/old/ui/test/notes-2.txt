main block:
  pointer to root directory block
    (pointer = 4-char binary address)
  pointer to recycle bin
  pointer to last block
  user info (user hash, salt, etc.)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
directory block:
  name of/pointers to directory blocks
    (name = 255-char string)
  name of/pointer to/length of file blocks
  pointer to next sequence block
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
file block:
  pointer to next sequence block (if applicable, otherwise null)
  raw binary data of file
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
recycle bin block:
  pointer to/length of file blocks (no name)
  pointer to next sequence block

first run:
  request new credentials
    require confirmation?
  create/write to main, system, and recycle bin blocks

after login:
  read last block address into memory
  read full recycle bin into memory
  read/apply settings in /sys/config
  show root directory OR directory set in config

add file:
  get size of file
  check recycle bin for available space (<= size of file)
    if found {
      use address from recycle bin as start
      remove record form recycle bin
    }
  allocate space as needed
    initialize file blocks
    write new file info to directory
  do {
    copy encrypted data to next block
  } while full content not yet written

delete file:
  remove file info from directory (write code to reuse chunk later)
  check recycle bin for adjacent blocks
    consolidate blocks in recycle bin
  write new recycle bin data

open file:
  get file name / size of file (already in memory)
  do {
    copy dectyped data from block to tmp location
  } while next sequence is not null
  launch tmp file (?)
